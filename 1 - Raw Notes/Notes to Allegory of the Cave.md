We have Socrates and Claucon talking to each other. First glance, it's clear that Socrates has much more dialog than Claucon. 

- Nature of Ignorance and education

## Scenario

### First information's

"Imagine human beings living in an underground cave-like residence. Its entrance opens up to the light and reaches all along
the cave. They have been there since their childhood, their ankles and necks chained,
unable to move or turn their heads, forced to look ahead. The light from a fire blazing at a
distance comes from above and behind them. Between the fire and the prisoners there is a
raised walkway. Imagine also a low wall built along the way, similar to the screen that
divides puppeteers from the audience and allows them to show puppets over it."
_Line 3-9_

Humans chained in a room, forced to look at exactly one spot. They were there since their childhood. There is a wall behind(?) the Prisoners
On the wall there is a walkway

Further, he describes how the people on the wall carry "strange artifacts, that extend above the wall". These include materials like wood or stone, shaped like humans or animals. These artifacts would create a shadow, visible for the prisoners, while they dont' see any sign that the artifacts are being carried or not alive.

He goes on to talk about how if the prisoners were able to talk, the topic of speech would be the shadows of the artifacts. -> We only talk about things we see?

Socrates then describes, that if one of the persons carrying an artifact were to speak, the prisoners would assume, that it was the shadows voice. 

"Such prisoners would think that the truth is nothing but the shadows cast by the artifacts."
We only see the Truth in what we believe is real, based on our 5 senses

He proceeds to explain how if the prisoners would be released, and pointed out for their wrong assumptions , that they would still believe in these wrong truths. -> Its shows, that we are often bound to our ideologies and believes, how we can't easily except big changes in our world view.

He explains that if the prisoners would be forced to stare into the light, they much rather would like to look away, back to the shadows, believing that these are much more clearer. Its a clear metaphor how we look back at our old believes more than we look forward to new ideas that might hurt at first. 

If one of these prisoners is getting dragged out to the sun, it would hurt their eyes. They wouldn't be able to see the truth instantly.

He proceeds to describe how the prisoners would  only slowly be able to see people through the reflection of water, then normally and finally would be able to look into the sky. But also how they still would be more comfortable to look into the night sky, to only have the shallow, cold light of the moon and the stars. 

Socrates goes on to say how the prisoners would be able to look at the sun at the end, and figure out that it "governs all that exists in the visible world."
