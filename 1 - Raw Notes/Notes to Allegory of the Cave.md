## Scenario

### First information's

"Imagine human beings living in an underground cave-like residence. Its entrance opens up to the light and reaches all along
the cave. They have been there since their childhood, their ankles and necks chained,
unable to move or turn their heads, forced to look ahead. The light from a fire blazing at a
distance comes from above and behind them. Between the fire and the prisoners there is a
raised walkway. Imagine also a low wall built along the way, similar to the screen that
divides puppeteers from the audience and allows them to show puppets over it."
_Line 3-9_

Humans chained in a room, forced to look at exactly one spot. They were there since their childhood. There is a wall behind(?) the Prisoners
On the wall there is a walkway
