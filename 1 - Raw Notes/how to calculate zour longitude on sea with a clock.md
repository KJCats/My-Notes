# how to calculate your longitude on sea with a clock

After the [Scilly naval disaster of 1707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707 "Scilly naval disaster of 1707") the Brittish Partament under Queen Anne was offering £20.000 (roughly £4 million in 2023) to anyone who could solve the problem of calculating the longitude at sea.
