# how to calculate your longitude on sea with a clock

After the [Scilly naval disaster of 1707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707 "Scilly naval disaster of 1707") the British Parlament under Queen Anne was offering £20.000 (roughly £4 million in 2023) to anyone who could solve the Longitude problem. 
To travel on sea a sailor had to know their latitude (distance from the equator) and longitude. 
Calculating the distance to the equator was easy.
