# Calculating your latitude

## At Night

At night its really easy to find your latitude if you are on the Northern Hemisphere. 
You simple take the angle between the Polar Star and the Horizon. 

On the southern Hemisphere you need to find the [[Crux]]. Then, extend the long axis of the crux downwards a total of 4.5 times.
The empty spot in the sky where you are now is knows as the [[South Celestial Pole]]
Now the angle to that point is your latitude. 

## At Day

At day you need a stick that's put vertically into the ground. This is difficult on a ship, but better than nothing. 
Get the moment where the sticks shadow is the shortest, that's the local midday.
Now calculate this: $$Sun\ Angle = arctan(\frac{Stick\ Lenght}{Shadow\ Lenght})$$ Calculate the Zenit angle with this formula: $$Zenit\ Angle = 90\degree - Sun\ Angle$$
Now look up the Sun declination and calculate your latitude:$$Latitude = Zenit\ Angle + Sun's\ Declination$$
