# How to Analyze Books

## Book Selection

- Read what you want!
- Don't read books only because others say you have to.
- Find recommendation's in your interested Topics

### Inspect the Book

Read a few pages and answer:

- What type of Book is it? (Novel, Biography, ...)
- What is the Book about? (History, Politics, ...)
- Is it interesting or worth your attention?

## Note Taking

If you can or want, write into the Book. If not, write down on a seperate medium.

- Read actively!
- Less is more!
- Highlight only what is important. "If everything is highlighted, nothing is"
- Write down why it is highlighted. 
- Write down what you think.
- Try out what works best!!!

## Analyze 

Its not directly fun, but its worth it.

### Source Notes

- Write down all your notes in one place .
- Use Quotes and show where notes came from.
