# Language shapes Attention

When you don't have a word for something specific, you don't really give it the attention it should or could have. As an example, the German word "aufarbeiten" can be translated into working through or tidying something up. But these are general translations, that don't carry the same emotionale weight as the German original. A more direct translation would be to work up (auf = up, Arbeit = work). Its describes the process of going back to your past and working on accepting, or processing the past, in therapy or alone.

We also have to think more about sentence structure or the exact meaning of words, something that becomes natural when we stop translating our thoughts, but start thinking in the other language. Although we might not be as eloquent as in our native tongue, we are more active in our pronunciation and choice of words.
