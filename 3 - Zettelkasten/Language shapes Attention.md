# Language shapes Attention

When you don't have a specific word for something, you often fail to give it the attention it deserves. For example, the German word 'aufarbeiten' can be loosely translated as 'working through' or 'tidying something up'. But these are general translations, that don't carry the same emotionale weight as the German original. A more direct translation would be to work up (auf = up, Arbeit = work). Its describes the process of going back to your past and working on accepting, or processing the past, in therapy or alone.

We also have to think more about sentence structure or the exact meaning of words, something that becomes natural when we stop translating our thoughts, but start thinking in the other language. Although we might not be as eloquent as in our native tongue, we are more active in our pronunciation and choice of words.

Learning another language can open us up for new ideas and even reveal flaws or missing words in our own language. It shows cultural differences and similarities, it makes us understand how people in another country differ in their way of thinking.
