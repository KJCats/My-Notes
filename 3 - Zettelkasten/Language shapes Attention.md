# Language shapes Attention

When you don't have a specific word for something, you often fail to give it the attention it deserves. For example, the German word 'aufarbeiten' can be loosely translated as 'working through' or 'tidying something up'. However, these general translations don't carry the same emotional weight as the German original. A more direct translation would be to work up (auf = up, Arbeit = work). It describes the process of going back to your past and working on accepting, or processing the past, in therapy or alone.

We also have to think more carefully about sentence structure and the precise meaning of words. This becomes second nature when we stop translating our thoughts and start thinking directly in the other language. Although we might not be as eloquent as in our native tongue, we are more active in our pronunciation and choice of words.

Learning another language can open us up to new ideas and even reveal flaws or missing words in our own language. It shows cultural differences and similarities, and it helps us understand how people in another country think differently.
