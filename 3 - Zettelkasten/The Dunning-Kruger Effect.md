# The Dunning-Kruger-Effect

The Dunning-Kruger-Effect is a cognitive bias, where people with little to no competence in a
specific topic overestimate their knowledge and skills. On the other hand, people who are competent
in specific topics often underestimate their knowledge or skills.

This phenomenon occurs, because often the skills required to accurately evaluate performance, are
likely to be the same skills required to be performative. This results in a state where you are not
skilled enough for the task and not skilled enough to recognize your mistakes.
On the other hand, people who are highly competent tend to underestimate their abilities, since
they assume that task which are easy for them, also must be easy for everyone else.
The concept is named after *David Dunning* and *Justin Kruger*. They first documented study was
published in 1999. They were inspired by the real-life bank robber *McArthur Wheeler*, who thought
putting lemon juice on his face would make it invisible. 

The effect can be seen all over the world. The new employee with limited experience, people on
social media or an amateur athlete. All of these are at a point where they think they have the skills
and knowledge required to outperform everyone else, while only being at the beginning of the
learning curve. 
It can also be seen on the other side of the spectrum. A top performing student, a talented engineer
or  a lifelong artist. They all think that if the task at hand is easy for them, it has to be easy for
everyone.    

But how can we overcome the effect? How do we even know on which side of the spectrum we are?
The best way is to get constant and honest feedback from people that are likely to be knowledge.
That could be a seasoned employee at your work or the smart student who only gets perfect scores. 
You have to keep learning, to overcome the feeling of not knowing anything. Everything you learn
opens up a minimum of two new topics you don't know anything about, but you don't have to know everything. 
 Question your knowledge. You think you know something? Ask yourself how you came to that conclusion. 
And finally, one of the most effective learning methods, teach others. If you can't teach a concept to someone else, you know you don't
fully understand it yet.
