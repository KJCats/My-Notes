# Should Magic be weirder?

When we as authors create Magic, we most likely know its rules, think about how it impacts the world around it. But this is different than how magic in things like folklore is described. In folklore, we now know none of the myths were real, or not to the extend they are told. But still the people believed in them. So why wouldn't people in a fantasy setting with Magic, create stories about more magic. Why wouldn't folklore exsist in fantasy?
